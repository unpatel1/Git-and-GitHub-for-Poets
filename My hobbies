I have a few hobbies which I am going to describe in the document.

Astronomy: This is probably my oldest hobby. It was my Dad's hobby and I got it from him. I remember when I was a very little kid (may be 
2 ~ 3 years old), my Dad started to show me the night sky. Sometimes when he was taking me out on his bicycle during evening after dark, he 
would stop his bicycle on the side of the road and show me planets, constellations and bright stars.


Photography: This was also my Dad's hobby but I started after I finished my college education.


Industrial Designing: I liked industrial design subject area since I was a child. I think I can indirectly relate this to my Dad as well.


Robotics: This is relatively my new hobby in the sense of knowledge. I started around 2000 or so but didn't spend much time because of 
steep learning curve that includes new areas such as electrical and electronics technology.

3D-printing: 3D printing is a very new hobby which I probably started around 2015 or so.




Astrophysics: This is actually related to Astronomy. It evolved gradually over time. Because of unfavorable weather condition in Chicago
area, I couldn't spend much time for observational astronomy. So I started reading in Astrophysics and now I spend a lot more time in 
Astrophysics than Astronomy.
